10:T6b7,<p>The Contemporary Craft Center is a place that enthusiastically embraces and promotes the exploration of a wide range of unique craft materials, inviting people to unleash their endless creativity and bring their artistic visions to life.</p>
<p>Scent Chords is an experimental lab situatedwithin the Contemporary Craft Center. While it draws the inspiration from the pioneering 19th-century chemist and perfumer, Septimus Piesse, as it delves into the intriguing fusionof craft, sound, and smell.</p>
<p>There are two parts about the project:</p>
<p>1. Personalized Postcard Creation with p5.js</p>
<p>With the p5.js code provided, users have the ability to craft their unique postcards featuring specially designed fonts. The customization options include adjusting various pitches using sliders, selecting preferred colors, and adding personalized text.</p>
<p>Once the postcard is tailored to individual preferences, users can save their creation and easily print it out for a tangible keepsake.</p>
<p>2. The Processing and Arduino-Powered Musical Installation</p>
<p>Inspired by Piesse’s ‘Odophone,’ the theory linking smells to Western musical pitches, this project focuses on seven pitches and their corresponding scents. The innovative design aims to visually represent each sound and scent through fluid simulation. Simultaneously, the system integrates a color-coding scheme, with each sound-smell pair having an associated color. The device activates a humidifier to emit the scent whenever the corresponding color fluid is drawn on the screen. Additional buttons provide the flexibility to change the color choice, enhancing the multisensory experience of this interactive musical installation.</p>11:T4e9,<p>The PA Member Card Generator is an interactive design experience. The main idea behind the design was to embody the essence of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The concept came from a desire to create bonds and community between the audience and the aquarium. This project aims to attract visitors to the aquarium’s membership program by providing a novel and customized user experience. That allows members to create their own customized cards.</p>
<p>This generator allows for a variety of options: three font types, four patterns, unit scale, density, also font and background colors.</p>
<p>This DIY method is available on the Pacific Aquarium website as an online version and can be found at the Aquarium Store as a physical screen.</p>
<p>The generated design and typography become part of the Pacific Aquarium’s brand delivery, enhancing its identity and the community aspect of audience connection. The program is not only an innovative approach to generative typography but also a strategic idea for the Pacific Aquarium to enhance brand engagement and customer experience.</p>
<p>This Generator used different designs developed on p5.js, and later integrated and organized them using Processing to improve rendering efficiency and performance.</p>12:T56c,<p>H. Lorenzo is a fashion boutique known for curating avant-garde and high-end designer clothing. It’s recognized for its unique selection of clothing, often featuring cutting-edge designs and emerging designers alongside established luxury brands.</p>
<p>I’ve crafted an avant-garde brand tone in my branding project, blending elegance and simplicity into the exclusive H Type font for H.Lorenzo. Beyond this, I aspire to elevate our brand’s spatial design, inviting customers into an immersive experience that embodies unconventional attitudes.</p>
<p>From the perspective of materials, I used different curves to create the effect of cloth and controlled the movement of the shape through the X and Y axes of the mouse to bring about different dynamics. At the same time, I added sliders to the code to control the shape and color. From black and white to primary color.</p>
<p>I then added key press controls, using ‘b’ and ‘w’ to change the theme color of the background, ‘backspace’ to clear the content on the canvas, ‘up’ and ‘down’ to control the speed of shape generation, and ‘f’ to Stop generation, ‘p’ turns on full screen mode and ‘s’ to save pattern.</p>
<p>After all that, I feel mouse movement is not enough and I added body tracking model ml5 to my code to use camera tracking body as the source that driven pattern generation.</p>6:["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-3","children":[["$","$Lf","zitong-wang",{"id":"zitong-wang","author":"Zitong Wang","title":"Scent Chords","description":"$10","videoSrc":"/gentype/semesters/fa23/videos/zitong-wang.mp4","posterSrc":"/gentype/semesters/fa23/posters/zitong-wang.jpg","links":[{"text":"View Sketch","url":"https://editor.p5js.org/zwang30/full/iLY14kLbz"}]}],["$","$Lf","elton-tinoco",{"id":"elton-tinoco","author":"Elton Tinoco","title":"Literati Composer","description":"<p>Literati Composer is a user-friendly postcard/poster generator that allows individuals to effortlessly create small 4-inch x 6-inch postcards or scale up to 24- inch x 36-inch posters.
