10:T4fd,<p>The Duomo Museum (Museo del Duomo) originates inside the Duomo cathedral (Duomo di Milano) in Italy. They are exhibiting heritage marble sculptures and paintings; This is where you can enjoy the beautiful colors of sacred stained glass and artworks from over 600 years of history. I visited Duomo di Milano back in 2016 with my friend. I was amazed by the magnificent cathedral when I got out of the subway station. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I had ever seen. Out of everything else, I loved the geometric yet delicate architectural motifs the most.</p>
<p>The Duomo module-type generator’s main concept is creating a module type inspired by motifs from the gothic Duomo cathedral. Each letter design produced from the generator will be part of the branding deliverables in many applications. The primary touch point with the audience is at a ticket purchase machine. Each museum customer can interact with the Duomo module-type generator by typing their name for the ticket purchase to the exhibition. Audiences can choose between twelve module shapes and can control their size, density, rotation, and background colors. Each of them will get their own uniquely designed tickets as souvenirs before entering the cathedral and exhibition.</p>11:T406,<p>Try-Me is an interactive design experience for the users at The Textile Museum. It is a customizable souvenir postcard you can take home to remember your special visit. It includes all the artists that are featured at the Museum and the museum’s unique logo.</p>
<p>Penny-pressed souvenirs have always been one of my go-to things to do when I’m somewhere new and I was interested in making something like this that can be easy but a bit more personal. I wanted to create an interactive experience where the user can directly participate in making their own souvenir, choosing their own colors and layouts.</p>
<p>The vibrant colors and unique typeface go together to provide something that feels much more alive. There is a random button to change the layouts that never land on the same layout more than once, a slider to zoom in and out, and three sliders for the background colors. They are in RGB mode(Rslider, Gslider, Bslider) from left to right. The designed postcard is also available to download as a png file.</p>6:["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-3","children":[["$","$Lf","kenny-zhang",{"id":"kenny-zhang","author":"Kenny Zhang","title":"A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems","description":"<p>A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961.
