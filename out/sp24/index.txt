10:T43d,<p>Interwoven is an upcoming solo exhibition by Samantha Bittman at MCASD, showcasing her unique approach to textile art. Bittman‚Äôs works blend traditional craftsmanship with digital design, creating a fascinating interplay between the physical and the virtual. Her intricate geometric patterns, initially conceived using digital tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, are meticulously hand-woven and further enhanced with acrylic paint, resulting in captivating textures and material qualities.</p>
<p>Through this exhibition, viewers are invited to engage with the concept of ‚Äúweaving‚Äù in a novel and interactive way. A digital loom, created using P5.JS, allows users to draw patterns on a canvas using their mouse, mimicking the motion of a shuttle. As the mouse glides across the vertical lines on the screen, patterns emerge, enabling users to create their own digital textile works. This immersive experience offers a unique exploration of the relationship between the physical and the digital, inviting viewers to appreciate the art of weaving from a fresh perspective.</p>11:T538,<p>This is part of the rebranding project for Pioneer Works in the type 5 class.</p>
<p>Pioneer Works is a cultural space in New York, where artists and scientists come together to create new ideas. They aim to foster artists at the intersection of art, music, science, and technology. They provide many events and activities, exhibitions, and residency programs.</p>
<p>The reason why I chose this organization is Because I wanted it to explore the harmony between art and technology. I was curious about the connection between the two. Also, I was interested in their point of view that Science is a part of the culture and they value the cultural impact of scientific thinking.</p>
<p>In this project, I built an interactive installation for the annual event called Pioneer Play Lab. Play lab is an event that celebrates residency works and people can join and be immersed in the interplay between art and technology. This installation is going to be at the entrance of the space. The installation concept brings the interaction between technology and art to life, creating an immersive experience. When users walk by, the image of an artist‚Äôs piece is heightened and pops up in an interactive form. I want people to be more engaged in these events and also get some overview of the events like which artists are participating.</p>6:["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-3","children":[["$","$Lf","elliana-lee",{"id":"elliana-lee","author":"Elliana Lee","title":"Live!
