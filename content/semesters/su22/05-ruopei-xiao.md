88rising is a company that has gained popularity as a musical platform and record label primarily for Asian American and Asian artists who release music in the United States. The founder of 88rising hopes the music it produced can bridge the gap between Asian and American music. Keeping producing experimental music going viral among young generations, 88rising gathers talented music artists to create new trends in pop culture.

This project is an exploration of music visualization inspired by the 88rising brand along with Head in the Clouds the music event curated by it. All the music-reacting animations were made on Processing. The music is from Blank&Jones, named Winelight. All the background images and footage were materials found on the Internet.
