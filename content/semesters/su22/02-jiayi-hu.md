\>X is an experimental typeface design project. Through processing, this project built a physical font system using Geomerative and Fisica. Just like the skeleton binding of the animation, the anchor points on the outer outline of the font are bound by joints, giving the dynamic font more variability and organic feel. This visual system discusses the possibility of giving type and graphics a spontaneous and flexible characteristic.
