Bloom is an infographic, interactive experience for The Huntington. It showcases its gardens and unique plants in a playful, typographic way.

Analog making has always been a significant part of my creative process. I am interested in combinging analog and generative design methods, challenging myself to design a digital interface with an organic aesthetic.

Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The Huntingtonâ€™s different gardens as units that formulate the names of the gardens. Users can use the arrow keys to visit different virtual gardens.

The sketch mainly uses the Geomerative and peasycam libraries. The Geomerative library turns the outlines of the letters into points. The points are replaced by the illustration PNGs. Peasycam allows users to rotate and zoom in and out of the gardens to observe the sketch from different angles.
