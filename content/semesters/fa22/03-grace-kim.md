The Duomo Museum (Museo del Duomo) originates inside the Duomo cathedral (Duomo di Milano) in Italy. They are exhibiting heritage marble sculptures and paintings; This is where you can enjoy the beautiful colors of sacred stained glass and artworks from over 600 years of history. I visited Duomo di Milano back in 2016 with my friend. I was amazed by the magnificent cathedral when I got out of the subway station. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I had ever seen. Out of everything else, I loved the geometric yet delicate architectural motifs the most.

The Duomo module-type generatorâ€™s main concept is creating a module type inspired by motifs from the gothic Duomo cathedral. Each letter design produced from the generator will be part of the branding deliverables in many applications. The primary touch point with the audience is at a ticket purchase machine. Each museum customer can interact with the Duomo module-type generator by typing their name for the ticket purchase to the exhibition. Audiences can choose between twelve module shapes and can control their size, density, rotation, and background colors. Each of them will get their own uniquely designed tickets as souvenirs before entering the cathedral and exhibition.
