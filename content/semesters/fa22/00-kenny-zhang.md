A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961. It is built as a set of 10 sonnets, with each line on a separate strip that can be combined infinitely, for a total of 100,000,000,000,000 different poems.

This project uses generative typography that brings the bookâ€™s content into creative coding. By reconstructing the 10 sonnets into an interactive 3D experience, it explores the intersection between poem and code and the transformation of poems from print-based to code-based media.
