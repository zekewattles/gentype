Try-Me is an interactive design experience for the users at The Textile Museum. It is a customizable souvenir postcard you can take home to remember your special visit. It includes all the artists that are featured at the Museum and the museum’s unique logo.

Penny-pressed souvenirs have always been one of my go-to things to do when I’m somewhere new and I was interested in making something like this that can be easy but a bit more personal. I wanted to create an interactive experience where the user can directly participate in making their own souvenir, choosing their own colors and layouts.

The vibrant colors and unique typeface go together to provide something that feels much more alive. There is a random button to change the layouts that never land on the same layout more than once, a slider to zoom in and out, and three sliders for the background colors. They are in RGB mode(Rslider, Gslider, Bslider) from left to right. The designed postcard is also available to download as a png file.
