Boiler Room teamed up with LAâ€™s Subculture Party to put together an explosive weekend of hyperpop, electronic, and experimental sounds. Having gone on Day 1, I thought it would be fun to take on the overwhelming event that it was (in terms of sounds, visuals, and people), and translate it into posters of my personal interpretation. I created a poster series that used sound visualization, mapping, and TextToPoints; some of the key skills I learned in Gen Type and now feel that I can apply to future projects.
