CES is an annual electronic trading show that brings newly released technologies to change peoplesâ€™ lives. Using p5.js, I created a generative branding tool that allows for randomness and flexibility. CES is a future-thinking expo with cutting edge technology, so I wanted the identity to reflect that by using code-based tools.
