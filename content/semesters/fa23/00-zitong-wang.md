The Contemporary Craft Center is a place that enthusiastically embraces and promotes the exploration of a wide range of unique craft materials, inviting people to unleash their endless creativity and bring their artistic visions to life.

Scent Chords is an experimental lab situatedwithin the Contemporary Craft Center. While it draws the inspiration from the pioneering 19th-century chemist and perfumer, Septimus Piesse, as it delves into the intriguing fusionof craft, sound, and smell.

There are two parts about the project:

1\. Personalized Postcard Creation with p5.js

With the p5.js code provided, users have the ability to craft their unique postcards featuring specially designed fonts. The customization options include adjusting various pitches using sliders, selecting preferred colors, and adding personalized text.

Once the postcard is tailored to individual preferences, users can save their creation and easily print it out for a tangible keepsake.

2\. The Processing and Arduino-Powered Musical Installation

Inspired by Piesse’s ‘Odophone,’ the theory linking smells to Western musical pitches, this project focuses on seven pitches and their corresponding scents. The innovative design aims to visually represent each sound and scent through fluid simulation. Simultaneously, the system integrates a color-coding scheme, with each sound-smell pair having an associated color. The device activates a humidifier to emit the scent whenever the corresponding color fluid is drawn on the screen. Additional buttons provide the flexibility to change the color choice, enhancing the multisensory experience of this interactive musical installation.
