This is visualization art using PhpStorm based on the sound decibel (dB). Particle numbers and shapes are expressed with the matching object by the level and effects of sound. At the death level of sound, the screen becomes black like game over. This is following the unconventional way of magazine WIRED’s information sharing. This visualization of sound effects on humans will be displayed in WIRED’s website as interaction with audience about technology and sound.
