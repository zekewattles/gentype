The PA Member Card Generator is an interactive design experience. The main idea behind the design was to embody the essence of the Pacific Ocean.

The concept came from a desire to create bonds and community between the audience and the aquarium. This project aims to attract visitors to the aquarium’s membership program by providing a novel and customized user experience. That allows members to create their own customized cards.

This generator allows for a variety of options: three font types, four patterns, unit scale, density, also font and background colors.

This DIY method is available on the Pacific Aquarium website as an online version and can be found at the Aquarium Store as a physical screen.

The generated design and typography become part of the Pacific Aquarium’s brand delivery, enhancing its identity and the community aspect of audience connection. The program is not only an innovative approach to generative typography but also a strategic idea for the Pacific Aquarium to enhance brand engagement and customer experience.

This Generator used different designs developed on p5.js, and later integrated and organized them using Processing to improve rendering efficiency and performance.
