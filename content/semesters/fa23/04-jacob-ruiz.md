The Portola Music Festival is San Franciscoâ€™s first electronic music festival. It is known for bringing musicians and artists from around the world to perform and exchange positive energy and frequencies through music.

At the festival, visualizers are an essential component to the overall experience. The concept of having a booth where attendees can control live visualizers for their favorite artist was the main goal to achieve.

These visualizers have particular presets that allow a specific variable to change so the user does not exceed what is necessary for the artist who is performing. With each visualizer being sound reactive, there is a constant change in each sketch which will allow for never ending stimulation as long as theres music playing.
