H. Lorenzo is a fashion boutique known for curating avant-garde and high-end designer clothing. It’s recognized for its unique selection of clothing, often featuring cutting-edge designs and emerging designers alongside established luxury brands.

I’ve crafted an avant-garde brand tone in my branding project, blending elegance and simplicity into the exclusive H Type font for H.Lorenzo. Beyond this, I aspire to elevate our brand’s spatial design, inviting customers into an immersive experience that embodies unconventional attitudes.

From the perspective of materials, I used different curves to create the effect of cloth and controlled the movement of the shape through the X and Y axes of the mouse to bring about different dynamics. At the same time, I added sliders to the code to control the shape and color. From black and white to primary color.

I then added key press controls, using ‘b’ and ‘w’ to change the theme color of the background, ‘backspace’ to clear the content on the canvas, ‘up’ and ‘down’ to control the speed of shape generation, and ‘f’ to Stop generation, ‘p’ turns on full screen mode and ‘s’ to save pattern.

After all that, I feel mouse movement is not enough and I added body tracking model ml5 to my code to use camera tracking body as the source that driven pattern generation.
