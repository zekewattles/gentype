Gridlock is an examination of the many graphic languages of Los Angeles and how these alternate design practices—those that run parallel to traditional design—might inform our individual processes. This year-long study represents my journey to understand and expand my own practice as a graphic designer, from exploring new tools and technologies to breaking free from a screen-based practice.

The website encapsulates my research and explorations from the project. It is also home to the generative sketch that showcases what is lost when we remove color and culture from the built environment. The sketch is built into the web experience using p5.js and bootstrap.
