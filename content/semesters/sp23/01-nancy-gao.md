Invisible Architecture is a bamboo installation exhibition by the Starn twins. It’s the invisible architecture of life and living things. It’s an organism that we are just a part of-helping it to develop along. The growth is always unfinished, yet it is always complete and constant.

Bamboo is the fastest growing plant. People can build their own typographic bamboo sculpture when they browse this website. As they scroll down the page, the “bamboo” will grow across the page, controlled by your mouse, giving people an immersive experience of being inside this invisible architecture, which is built by themselves.
