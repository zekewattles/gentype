These generative typography animations are designed for an entry wall for an exhibition called Forbidden Future which is about post-apocalyptic games. Post-apocalyptic games mostly tell stories of the extinction of human civilization due to disasters. Abandoned technology, nature, and unknown creatures are always the features of those games. In my design, microorganisms, the cycle of life, and the feeling of abandoned human existence will be the main design elements to bring a sense of mystery to the audience when they enter the exhibition.
