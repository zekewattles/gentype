Night Reimagined is an exhibition at the Griffith Observatory to inspire audience to understand the effects of light pollution and protect our night quality.

This project is part of the exhibition. It is an information graphic poster that allows audience to interact with the information presented. By selecting different state names, audience can have a simple understanding of light pollution situations in different states of the US, and be encouraged to take action to protect our night sky.

The state names on the poster are connected with real data about light strength, night quality, sky clarity, etc. All data used is real data from Globe at Night.
