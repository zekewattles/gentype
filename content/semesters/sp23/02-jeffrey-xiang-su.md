The DELVE Experience is an imaginative web-based journey that immerses users in a dream simulation inspired by the fictional DELVE technology from the team last dance’s AMS project. Harnessing the power of p5.js and Three.js, this captivating experience engages users through a combination of visual and auditory elements, culminating in a mesmerizing computer-generated short film set in a world where DELVE technology shapes the story. The project’s primary goal is to investigate the possibilities of web-enabled immersive experiences in entertainment and storytelling while broadening the skillset in 3D graphics using JavaScript and WebGL.
