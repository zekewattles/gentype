Live! From the Archive, is a month-long annual event that facilitates dialogue between historical founding artists of The Kitchen and contemporary curators and artists, and critics.

This installation at this event is by the entrance outside where there are lots of passerbyers. Promoting the Live! From the Archive! event, and the dancers and choreography performances by using posenet and machine learning in javascript. I bring the letterforms of the event, and have them assigned to each body part.
