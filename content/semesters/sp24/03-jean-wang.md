Images Festival is a year round, experimental independent film festival. Through the process of experimenting a new identity that expands traditional definitions of media art, I utilized creative coding that resulted in creative branding tools. The art generator in this project inputs still frames from the films as the art brush, letting the audience repurpose them to create new artworks.
