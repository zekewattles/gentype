This is part of the rebranding project for Pioneer Works in the type 5 class.

Pioneer Works is a cultural space in New York, where artists and scientists come together to create new ideas. They aim to foster artists at the intersection of art, music, science, and technology. They provide many events and activities, exhibitions, and residency programs.

The reason why I chose this organization is Because I wanted it to explore the harmony between art and technology. I was curious about the connection between the two. Also, I was interested in their point of view that Science is a part of the culture and they value the cultural impact of scientific thinking.

In this project, I built an interactive installation for the annual event called Pioneer Play Lab. Play lab is an event that celebrates residency works and people can join and be immersed in the interplay between art and technology. This installation is going to be at the entrance of the space. The installation concept brings the interaction between technology and art to life, creating an immersive experience. When users walk by, the image of an artistâ€™s piece is heightened and pops up in an interactive form. I want people to be more engaged in these events and also get some overview of the events like which artists are participating.
