ARKTOS is a collaboration between Arctic Ice Project and RAINS. The collaboration aims to raise awareness of the global climate change crisis we are currently in. Using p5.js, exhibition graphics were developed that expand on the existing visual language and bring the weather conditions of the Arctic as well as the world to the visitors of a pop up exhibition in New York City. The pop up exhibition creates a space for information, statistics and internal reflection.
