BeatLab, a workshop under MUSE:IQUE, embodies the belief that live music should be accessible to all. The design for Beat Lab aims to convey a sense of fun and inclusivity, using vibrant visuals to encapsulate the workshop’s dynamic and welcoming atmosphere.

The purpose of the BeatLab website is to provide an immersive digital platform where users can engage with a wide array of object sounds at the touch of a keyboard.

The BeatLab installation is specifically designed to introduce and demystify the workshop’s musical concepts to newcomers. This engaging setup serves as both an educational tool and a source of inspiration, making the world of music creation accessible to those unfamiliar with the workshop’s offerings.
