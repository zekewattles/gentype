LightScapes is a data-driven interactive installation for the Ocma. This piece is a visual representation of time. Using a historical history API, the data for hours of daylight in a day is collected and then translated into a visual language.

What happens if we look at this data set at different scales? How does one day compare to one century? What is your reaction to this, does your perception of time change? Do you react to this emotionally, intellectually, or physically?
