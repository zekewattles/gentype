Interwoven is an upcoming solo exhibition by Samantha Bittman at MCASD, showcasing her unique approach to textile art. Bittman’s works blend traditional craftsmanship with digital design, creating a fascinating interplay between the physical and the virtual. Her intricate geometric patterns, initially conceived using digital tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, are meticulously hand-woven and further enhanced with acrylic paint, resulting in captivating textures and material qualities.

Through this exhibition, viewers are invited to engage with the concept of “weaving” in a novel and interactive way. A digital loom, created using P5.JS, allows users to draw patterns on a canvas using their mouse, mimicking the motion of a shuttle. As the mouse glides across the vertical lines on the screen, patterns emerge, enabling users to create their own digital textile works. This immersive experience offers a unique exploration of the relationship between the physical and the digital, inviting viewers to appreciate the art of weaving from a fresh perspective.
