This project is an extension of my thesis, Empowering Non-Western Visual Languages, featuring an online poster generator that encourages audiences to reflect on their cultural identity and heritage. The generator serves as an interactive tool in offline workshop activities, demonstrating how diverse visual narratives can thrive beyond Eurocentric aesthetics. Participants can create personalized designs using cultural motifs, patterns, and symbols, sparking discussions about identity and representation. By combining technology with hands-on activities, this project emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and collaboration in redefining the global design landscape.
