ICA LA is a independently-run & non-collecting museum in Downtown Los Angeles, centering itself around the idea of creating a space in the community for creative experimentation & expression, fostering new perspectives that challenge our social norms, and engaging in dialogue for social change.

The generative tool is used for the installation of the museum, where visitors can see the overview of the institution as they enter the space â€” messages that resonate with ICA LA and as well as information on related programs.

This generative sketch is informed by and informs the visual identity of the institution, as the subdividing squares reflect the idea of getting deeper into the act of holding understanding and empathy for others around us.
