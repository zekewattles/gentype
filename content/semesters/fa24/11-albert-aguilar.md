The Museum of Modern Neon Art (MONA) is collaborating with the LA Art Show organization for an event at their museum. They need a title wall which is designed with audio-reactive typography. Title wall will include title of exhibition and participating artists. Instrumental electronic music will be played at a low volume over the speakers to provide further immersion to the event. Designer will utilize P5JS code in creating the title wall to meet proposal needs.
