The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is the largest museum in the United States devoted to the arts, sciences, and culture of moviemaking.

This project explores the intersection of generative design, interaction, and visual systems. Through a series of custom-built tools and prototypes, the work transforms the Academy Museum of Motion Picture’s brand identity into an expansive and dynamic visual system.
