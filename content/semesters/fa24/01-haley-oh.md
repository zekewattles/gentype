The Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas, founded by Donald Judd, is a contemporary art museum dedicated to preserving large-scale installations by artists like Judd, Dan Flavin, and Carl Andre. The foundation embodies Judd’s vision of blending art with the surrounding landscape. Inspired by Chinati’s connection to nature, I explored wind as an invisible force shaping the artworks. I envisioned an immersive installation that transforms this natural element into a tangible, interactive experience, aligning with Chinati’s minimalist ethos. The installation reacts to real-time wind speed, using p5.js and wind data from an API. Graphical elements rotate and move dynamically, responding to environmental changes and visitor interactions, creating a compelling connection between people, nature, and art.
