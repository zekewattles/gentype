ARTE Museum Las Vegas is a exhibit dedicated to immersive experiences; the main idea is to use the logos or graphical elements and turn them into a dynamic poster experience where when the person looks at the stationary poster and scan it on their phone it will give them a active video of the poster making it immersive.
