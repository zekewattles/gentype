Presented by The Frick Collection, this exhibition explores the intersection of classical Renaissance masterpieces and contemporary digital art, using coding and algorithmic processes to reinterpret the iconic visual language of the past. Form Revival delves into how modern digital techniques—such as pixelation, abstraction, and ASCII art—deconstruct and reconstruct traditional Renaissance works. The exhibition will examine the transition from analog craftsmanship to the new digital creative paradigms.

By applying coding to manipulate classic works, the exhibition invites viewers to see how Renaissance art can be fragmented and reassembled, maintaining its core aesthetic principles of proportion, balance, and harmony, while recontextualizing these elements for the digital age. The pixelated and geometric treatments mirror the fragmented ways in which modern audiences engage with historical art—through screens, algorithms. This fusion of old and new demonstrates the evolving relationship between art and technology, revealing how coding based art forms reimagine the meticulous details of classical masterpieces.

The exhibition highlights how these treatments preserve and evolve our appreciation of Renaissance themes, offering fresh perspectives in an ever-changing digital world.
