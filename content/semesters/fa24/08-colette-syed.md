EFLUX SPACE brings this online platform to a tangible space, hosting an interactive installation that encourages visitors to engage in typographic visualizations. This installation was created on p5.js, based on eflux’s journal, “What Does Love Got To Do With It?”. This is a collection of essays that explores love and intimacy through a critical lens. Visitors will enter this installation as a welcoming exhibition that introduces them to the space and engages them in examining how they explore intimacy. Words of their choosing are tracked by their body and facial expressions to show a connection between our physicality and our perception of certain words. Visitors will be able to have a photo-op experience with this interactive installation, engaging their senses and movement with the power of literature.
