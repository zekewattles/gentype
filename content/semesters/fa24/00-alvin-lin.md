Archiv des Wirrwarrs (Chaos Archive) is an interactive installation exploring the beauty of chaos and ambiguity through media art. This installation invites visitors to actively engage with ZKMâ€™s archival artworks, merging personal interaction and digital exploration.

Using p5.js and ml5.js, the installation operates in two parts. The Chaos Type transforms artist images into vibrant, illegible typography, reflecting themes of disruption and unpredictability. Living Chaos Archive incorporates live video input, turning visitor movements into dynamic ASCII visuals, overlaying archival artwork in a vivid interplay of history and interaction.

What emerges is a multi-layered experience that blurs the line between artist and participant. How does chaos inform creativity, and what happens when the viewer becomes part of the archive? The installation challenges visitors to explore these questions, offering a space where art, technology, and human interaction converge.
