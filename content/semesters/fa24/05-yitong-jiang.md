Remote Sensing is an exhibition hosted by CLUI—The Center for Land Use Interpretation. 

As the “eyes in the sky,” remote sensing technology visualizes otherwise invisible data, such as CO2 emissions, by defining and decoding colors. Through this installation, I aim to help people understand how remote sensing expressively conveys data through color and dynamics.

In the early stages, I experimented with various ways to represent data using p5.js. By linking to remote sensing techniques, I utilized gradients to recreate daily CO2 emissions from 1970 to 2020 and displayed the data within a 3D space. I also explored multiple methods to present the underlying driving data. Remote sensing is not only a well-established science but also an art that integrates creativity, subjectivity, and interpretation.
