              <h2>Generative<br />Typography</h2>
              <p>
                Generative Typography is an introductory creative coding class for designers, working primarily in
                p5.js. I’ve been teaching it at ArtCenter College of Design since Summer 2022, building largely off the
                <a href="http://www.transmedia.graphics/gentype/index.html" target="_blank">work</a> of Roy Tatum and
                Brad Bartlett. This microsite functions as an archival space to showcase student work.

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961. It is built as a set of
              10 sonnets, with each line on a separate strip that can be combined infinitely, for a total of
              100,000,000,000,000 different poems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project uses generative typography that brings the book’s content into creative coding. By
              reconstructing the 10 sonnets into an interactive 3D experience, it explores the intersection between poem
              and code and the transformation of poems from print-based to code-based media.

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Duomo Museum (Museo del Duomo) originates inside the Duomo cathedral (Duomo di Milano) in Italy. They
              are exhibiting heritage marble sculptures and paintings; This is where you can enjoy the beautiful colors
              of sacred stained glass and artworks from over 600 years of history. I visited Duomo di Milano back in
              2016 with my friend. I was amazed by the magnificent cathedral when I got out of the subway station. It
              was one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I had ever seen. Out of everything else, I loved the
              geometric yet delicate architectural motifs the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Duomo module-type generator’s main concept is creating a module type inspired by motifs from the
              gothic Duomo cathedral. Each letter design produced from the generator will be part of the branding
              deliverables in many applications. The primary touch point with the audience is at a ticket purchase
              machine. Each museum customer can interact with the Duomo module-type generator by typing their name for
              the ticket purchase to the exhibition. Audiences can choose between twelve module shapes and can control
              their size, density, rotation, and background colors. Each of them will get their own uniquely designed
              tickets as souvenirs before entering the cathedral and exhibition.
            </p>

              Boiler Room teamed up with LA’s Subculture Party to put together an explosive weekend of hyperpop,
              electronic, and experimental sounds. Having gone on Day 1, I thought it would be fun to take on the
              overwhelming event that it was (in terms of sounds, visuals, and people), and translate it into posters of
              my personal interpretation. I created a poster series that used sound visualization, mapping, and
              TextToPoints; some of the key skills I learned in Gen Type and now feel that I can apply to future
              projects.

              Try-Me is an interactive design experience for the users at The Textile Museum. It is a customizable
              souvenir postcard you can take home to remember your special visit. It includes all the artists that are
              featured at the Museum and the museum’s unique logo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Penny-pressed souvenirs have always been one of my go-to things to do when I’m somewhere new and I was
              interested in making something like this that can be easy but a bit more personal. I wanted to create an
              interactive experience where the user can directly participate in making their own souvenir, choosing
              their own colors and layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vibrant colors and unique typeface go together to provide something that feels much more alive. There
              is a random button to change the layouts that never land on the same layout more than once, a slider to
              zoom in and out, and three sliders for the background colors. They are in RGB mode(Rslider, Gslider,
              Bslider) from left to right. The designed postcard is also available to download as a png file.

              Bloom is an infographic, interactive experience for The
              Huntington. It showcases its gardens and unique plants in a
              playful, typographic way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Analog making has always been a significant part of my creative
              process. I am interested in combinging analog and generative
              design methods, challenging myself to design a digital interface
              with an organic aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The
              Huntington's different gardens as units that formulate the names
              of the gardens. Users can use the arrow keys to visit different
              virtual gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sketch mainly uses the Geomerative and peasycam libraries.
              The Geomerative library turns the outlines of the letters into
              points. The points are replaced by the illustration PNGs.
              Peasycam allows users to rotate and zoom in and out of the
              gardens to observe the sketch from different angles.

            <p>
              FLEE is a brand identity generator designed to give flea market
              vendors the freedom to create their own visual identities and
              collateral.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name "FLEE" is inspired by the timelessness of flea markets,
              encouraging shoppers to escape from the present and travel to
              different eras.
            </p>
            <p>
              FLEE's vintage funky colors and random variations provide a
              unique playfulness that current flea market identities usually
              lack. The generator contains six different types of brushes, a
              clear canvas function, and a save image function. The user can
              also create with a scatter brush, a sticker brush, and a typing
              brush in the generator.

              >X is an experimental typeface design project. Through
              processing, this project built a physical font system using
              Geomerative and Fisica. Just like the skeleton binding of the
              animation, the anchor points on the outer outline of the font
              are bound by joints, giving the dynamic font more variability
              and organic feel. This visual system discusses the possibility
              of giving type and graphics a spontaneous and flexible
              characteristic.

              Storm King Art Center is dedicated to exhibiting, acquiring,
              borrowing, and conserving modern art and contemporary art. The
              focus on large-scale sculptures in an expansive landscape, to

              nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              The phrase "connect to art, connect to nature" is a brand
              narrative. Storm King Art Center nurtures a vibrant bond between
              art, nature, and people, creating a place where discovery is
              limitless. Each small particles used in the design represents
              art, nature, and people, vibrantly bonding to connect to each
              other to form the phrase "connect to art, connect to nature".
            </p>
            <p>
              The custom typeface has been designed to be responsive and
              activated by motion. To achieve this, the typeface was put into
              code and synced with the movement so that the particles
              responded to the movement.

              88rising is a company that has gained popularity as a musical
              platform and record label primarily for Asian American and Asian
              artists who release music in the United States. The founder of
              88rising hopes the music it produced can bridge the gap between
              Asian and American music. Keeping producing experimental music
              going viral among young generations, 88rising gathers talented
              music artists to create new trends in pop culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is an exploration of music visualization inspired
              by the 88rising brand along with Head in the Clouds the music
              event curated by it. All the music-reacting animations were made
              on Processing. The music is from Blank&Jones, named Winelight.
              All the background images and footage were materials found on
              the Internet.
