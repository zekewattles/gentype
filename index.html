                Bloom is an infographic, interactive experience for The
                Huntington. It showcases its gardens and unique plants in a
                playful, typographic way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Analog making has always been a significant part of my creative
                process. I am interested in combinging analog and generative
                design methods, challenging myself to design a digital interface
                with an organic aesthetic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The
                Huntington's different gardens as units that formulate the names
                of the gardens. Users can use the arrow keys to visit different
                virtual gardens.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sketch mainly uses the Geomerative and peasycam libraries.
                The Geomerative library turns the outlines of the letters into
                points. The points are replaced by the illustration PNGs.
                Peasycam allows users to rotate and zoom in and out of the
                gardens to observe the sketch from different angles.

                >X is an experimental typeface design project. Through
                processing, this project built a physical font system using
                Geomerative and Fisica. Just like the skeleton binding of the
                animation, the anchor points on the outer outline of the font
                are bound by joints, giving the dynamic font more variability
                and organic feel. This visual system discusses the possibility
                of giving type and graphics a spontaneous and flexible
                characteristic.

                FLEE is a flea market visual design generator. Most flea markets
                currently lack a clear brand identity that can self a generative
                collateral design based on the theme and locations. The visual
                design generator is named FLEE, which hopes people can time
                travel from current to any period. On the other way also fits
                the flea market's spiritual. The generator contains six
                different types of brushes, a clear canvas function, and a save
                image function. The user can explore with a scatter brush,
                sticker brush, and typing brush in the generator. The generator
                focuses on randomness and vintage funky color variations.

                Storm King Art Center is dedicated to exhibiting, acquiring,

              <p>
                The phrase "connect to art, connect to nature" is a brand
                narrative. Storm King Art Center nurtures a vibrant bond between
                art, nature, and people, creating a place where discovery is
                limitless. Each small particles used in the design represents
                art, nature, and people, vibrantly bonding to connect to each

                The custom typeface has been designed to be responsive and
                activated by motion. To achieve this, the typeface was put into
                code and synced with the movement so that the particles
                responded to the movement.

                platform and record label primarily for Asian American and Asian
                artists who release music in the United States. The founder of

                Asian and American music. Keeping producing experimental music
                going viral among young generations, 88rising gathers talented
                music artists to create new trends in pop culture.
