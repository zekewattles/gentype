              <h2>Generative<br />Typography</h2>
              <p>
                Generative Typography is an introductory creative coding class for designers, working primarily in
                p5.js. I’ve been teaching it at ArtCenter College of Design since Summer 2022, building largely off of
                the
                <a href="http://www.transmedia.graphics/gentype/index.html" target="_blank">work</a> of Roy Tatum and
                Brad Bartlett.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first half of the semester focuses on demos and exercises introducing students to p5.js, and
                the second half on students’ final projects. The prompt is totally self-directed and open-ended as long
                as
                it relates to type and code—some students combine it with another class and others just follow their
                passions. All students are required to create video documentation.

              Gridlock is an examination of the many graphic languages of Los Angeles and how these alternate design
              practices—those that run parallel to traditional design—might inform our individual processes. This
              year-long study represents my journey to understand and expand my own practice as a graphic designer, from
              exploring new tools and technologies to breaking free from a screen-based practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website encapsulates my research and explorations from the project. It is also home to the generative
              sketch that showcases what is lost when we remove color and culture from the built environment. The sketch
              is built into the web experience using p5.js and bootstrap.

              Invisible Architecture is a bamboo installation exhibition by the Starn twins. It’s the invisible
              architecture of life and living things. It’s an organism that we are just a part of-helping it to develop
              along. The growth is always unfinished, yet it is always complete and constant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bamboo is the fastest growing plant. People can build their own typographic bamboo sculpture when they
              browse this website. As they scroll down the page, the “bamboo” will grow across the page, controlled by
              your mouse, giving people an immersive experience of being inside this invisible architecture, which is
              built by themselves.

              The DELVE Experience is an imaginative web-based journey that immerses users in a dream simulation
              inspired by the fictional DELVE technology from the team last dance’s AMS project. Harnessing the power of
              p5.js and Three.js, this captivating experience engages users through a combination of visual and auditory
              elements, culminating in a mesmerizing computer-generated short film set in a world where DELVE technology
              shapes the story. The project’s primary goal is to investigate the possibilities of web-enabled immersive
              experiences in entertainment and storytelling while broadening the skillset in 3D graphics using
              JavaScript and WebGL.

              These generative typography animations are designed for an entry wall for an exhibition called Forbidden
              Future which is about post-apocalyptic games. Post-apocalyptic games mostly tell stories of the extinction
              of human civilization due to disasters. Abandoned technology, nature, and unknown creatures are always the
              features of those games. In my design, microorganisms, the cycle of life, and the feeling of abandoned
              human existence will be the main design elements to bring a sense of mystery to the audience when they
              enter the exhibition.

              This project is part of the exhibition. It is an information graphic poster that allows audience to
              interact with the information presented. By selecting different state names, audience can have a simple
              understanding of light pollution situations in different states of the US, and be encouraged to take
              action to protect our night sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              The state names on the poster are connected with real data about light strength, night quality, sky
              clarity, etc. All data used is real data from Globe at Night.

              “Flowing Narrative” showcases the artistic vision of Lygia Pape, a pioneering Brazilian artist who pushed
              the
              boundaries of traditional art forms to create dynamic and immersive experiences. Through her works, Pape
              explored
              themes of movement, light, and the human experience, often incorporating unconventional materials and
              techniques. This
              exhibition brings together a selection of Pape's most celebrated pieces, including installations,
              sculptures, and
              prints, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the artist's poetic and captivating world. With
              “Flowing
              Narrative,” we celebrate Lygia Pape's enduring legacy as a visionary artist who continues to inspire and
              challenge us
              with her extraordinary creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The exhibition’s website offers an interactive experience that allows users to view introductions about
              specific
              artworks. This unique feature presents a generative page containing elements from the artwork, bridging
              between the
              art and digital formats.

            <p>
              A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961. It is built as a set of
              10 sonnets, with each line on a separate strip that can be combined infinitely, for a total of
              100,000,000,000,000 different poems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project uses generative typography that brings the book’s content into creative coding. By
              reconstructing the 10 sonnets into an interactive 3D experience, it explores the intersection between poem
              and code and the transformation of poems from print-based to code-based media.

          <div>
            <p>
              The Duomo Museum (Museo del Duomo) originates inside the Duomo cathedral (Duomo di Milano) in Italy. They
              are exhibiting heritage marble sculptures and paintings; This is where you can enjoy the beautiful colors
              of sacred stained glass and artworks from over 600 years of history. I visited Duomo di Milano back in
              2016 with my friend. I was amazed by the magnificent cathedral when I got out of the subway station. It
              was one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I had ever seen. Out of everything else, I loved the
              geometric yet delicate architectural motifs the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Duomo module-type generator’s main concept is creating a module type inspired by motifs from the
              gothic Duomo cathedral. Each letter design produced from the generator will be part of the branding
              deliverables in many applications. The primary touch point with the audience is at a ticket purchase
              machine. Each museum customer can interact with the Duomo module-type generator by typing their name for
              the ticket purchase to the exhibition. Audiences can choose between twelve module shapes and can control
              their size, density, rotation, and background colors. Each of them will get their own uniquely designed
              tickets as souvenirs before entering the cathedral and exhibition.

              Boiler Room teamed up with LA’s Subculture Party to put together an explosive weekend of hyperpop,
              electronic, and experimental sounds. Having gone on Day 1, I thought it would be fun to take on the
              overwhelming event that it was (in terms of sounds, visuals, and people), and translate it into posters of
              my personal interpretation. I created a poster series that used sound visualization, mapping, and
              TextToPoints; some of the key skills I learned in Gen Type and now feel that I can apply to future
              projects.

              Try-Me is an interactive design experience for the users at The Textile Museum. It is a customizable

            <p>
              Penny-pressed souvenirs have always been one of my go-to things to do when I’m somewhere new and I was
              interested in making something like this that can be easy but a bit more personal. I wanted to create an
              interactive experience where the user can directly participate in making their own souvenir, choosing
              their own colors and layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vibrant colors and unique typeface go together to provide something that feels much more alive. There
              is a random button to change the layouts that never land on the same layout more than once, a slider to
              zoom in and out, and three sliders for the background colors. They are in RGB mode(Rslider, Gslider,
              Bslider) from left to right. The designed postcard is also available to download as a png file.

            <p>
              Analog making has always been a significant part of my creative
              process. I am interested in combinging analog and generative
              design methods, challenging myself to design a digital interface
              with an organic aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The
              Huntington's different gardens as units that formulate the names
              of the gardens. Users can use the arrow keys to visit different
              virtual gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sketch mainly uses the Geomerative and peasycam libraries.
              The Geomerative library turns the outlines of the letters into
              points. The points are replaced by the illustration PNGs.
              Peasycam allows users to rotate and zoom in and out of the
              gardens to observe the sketch from different angles.

              FLEE is a brand identity generator designed to give flea market

              collateral.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name "FLEE" is inspired by the timelessness of flea markets,
              encouraging shoppers to escape from the present and travel to
              different eras.
            </p>
            <p>
              FLEE's vintage funky colors and random variations provide a
              unique playfulness that current flea market identities usually
              lack. The generator contains six different types of brushes, a
              clear canvas function, and a save image function. The user can
              also create with a scatter brush, a sticker brush, and a typing
              brush in the generator.

              of giving type and graphics a spontaneous and flexible

              88rising is a company that has gained popularity as a musical
              platform and record label primarily for Asian American and Asian
              artists who release music in the United States. The founder of
              88rising hopes the music it produced can bridge the gap between
              Asian and American music. Keeping producing experimental music
              going viral among young generations, 88rising gathers talented
              music artists to create new trends in pop culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is an exploration of music visualization inspired
              by the 88rising brand along with Head in the Clouds the music
              event curated by it. All the music-reacting animations were made
              on Processing. The music is from Blank&Jones, named Winelight.
              All the background images and footage were materials found on
              the Internet.
