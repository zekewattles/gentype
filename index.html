        <h2>Jia Liu &mdash; Interwoven</h2>
        <p>
          Interwoven is an upcoming solo exhibition by Samantha Bittman at MCASD, showcasing her unique approach to
          textile art. Bittman’s works blend traditional craftsmanship with digital design, creating a fascinating
          interplay between the physical and the virtual. Her intricate geometric patterns, initially conceived using
          digital tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, are meticulously hand-woven and further enhanced with acrylic
          paint, resulting in captivating textures and material qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this exhibition, viewers are invited to engage with the concept of “weaving” in a novel and
          interactive way. A digital loom, created using P5JS, allows users to draw patterns on a canvas using their
          mouse, mimicking the motion of a shuttle. As the mouse glides across the vertical lines on the screen,
          patterns emerge, enabling users to create their own digital textile works. This immersive experience offers a
          unique exploration of the relationship between the physical and the digital, inviting viewers to appreciate
          the art of weaving from a fresh perspective.

        <p>
          This is part of the rebranding project for Pioneer Works in the type 5 class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pioneer Works is a cultural space in New York, where artists and scientists come together to create new ideas.
          They aim to foster artists at the intersection of art, music, science, and technology. They provide many
          events and activities, exhibitions, and residency programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why I chose this organization is Because I wanted it to explore the harmony between art and
          technology. I was curious about the connection between the two. Also, I was interested in their point of view
          that Science is a part of the culture and they value the cultural impact of scientific thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, I built an interactive installation for the annual event called Pioneer Play Lab. Play lab is
          an event that celebrates residency works and people can join and be immersed in the interplay between art and
          technology. This installation is going to be at the entrance of the space. The installation concept brings the
          interaction between technology and art to life, creating an immersive experience. When users walk by, the
          image of an artist’s piece is heightened and pops up in an interactive form. I want people to be more engaged
          in these events and also get some overview of the events like which artists are participating.

          range of unique craft materials, inviting people to unleash their endless creativity and bring their artistic
          visions to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scent Chords is an experimental lab situatedwithin the Contemporary Craft Center. While it draws the
          inspiration from the pioneering 19th-century chemist and perfumer, Septimus Piesse, as it delves into the
          intriguing fusionof craft, sound, and smell.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two parts about the project:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Personalized Postcard Creation with p5.js
        </p>
        <p>
          With the p5.js code provided, users have the ability to craft their unique postcards featuring specially
          designed fonts. The customization options include adjusting various pitches using sliders, selecting preferred
          colors, and adding personalized text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the postcard is tailored to individual preferences, users can save their creation and easily print it out
          for a tangible keepsake.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Processing and Arduino-Powered Musical Installation
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by Piesse’s ‘Odophone,’ the theory linking smells to Western musical pitches, this project focuses on
          seven pitches and their corresponding scents. The innovative design aims to visually represent each sound and
          scent through fluid simulation. Simultaneously, the system integrates a color-coding scheme, with each
          sound-smell pair having an associated color. The device activates a humidifier to emit the scent whenever the
          corresponding color fluid is drawn on the screen. Additional buttons provide the flexibility to change the
          color choice, enhancing the multisensory experience of this interactive musical installation.

        <h2>Mikayla Gao &mdash; PA Member Card Generator</h2>
        <p>
          The PA Member Card Generator is an interactive design experience. The main idea behind the design was to
          embody the essence of the Pacific Ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept came from a desire to create bonds and community between the audience and the aquarium. This
          project aims to attract visitors to the aquarium’s membership program by providing a novel and customized user
          experience. That allows members to create their own customized cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          This generator allows for a variety of options: three font types, four patterns, unit scale, density, also
          font and background colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This DIY method is available on the Pacific Aquarium website as an online version and can be found at the
          Aquarium Store as a physical screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The generated design and typography become part of the Pacific Aquarium’s brand delivery, enhancing its
          identity and the community aspect of audience connection. The program is not only an innovative approach to
          generative typography but also a strategic idea for the Pacific Aquarium to enhance brand engagement and
          customer experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Generator used different designs developed on p5.js, and later integrated and organized them using
          Processing to improve rendering efficiency and performance.

        <h2>Jacob Ruiz &mdash; Portola Music Festival Visualizers</h2>
        <p>
          The Portola Music Festival is San Francisco’s first electronic music festival. It is known for bringing
          musicians and artists from around the world to perform and exchange positive energy and fre- quencies through
          music.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the festival, visualizers are an essential component to the overall experience. The concept of having a
          booth where attendees can control live visualizers for their favorite artist was the main goal to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          These visualizers have particular pre-sets that allow a specific variable to change so the user does not
          exceed what is necessary for the artist who is performing. With each visualizer being sound reactive, there is
          a constant change in each sketch which will allow for never ending stimulation as long as theres music
          playing.

        <p>
          KCRW is a radio station based in LA, dedicated to reforming cultural connections and creative landscapes for
          Los Angelenos. The key elements for redesigning KCRW involve mixed culture transformation and reflection.
          Blurred and noisy effects on the typography represent the fusion of diverse cultures in Los Angeles, creating
          something new through transformation and mixed culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using P5.js, you can dynamically adjust the blur effect in sync with the sound’s key elements and use scaling
          to express rhythm more effectively, drawing inspiration from KCRW.

        <h2>Christina Liu &mdash; Mood Poster Generator</h2>
        <p>
          The Mood Poster Generator is a poster creation tool built on p5.js, designed to detect the user’s mood and
          generate corresponding posters. The user’s mood data is acquired through a temperature sensor. The visual
          elements of the poster are adjusted to reflect the user’s mood dynamically. For higher temperatures, the
          poster adopts warmer colors and more rounded shapes to convey a sense of happiness and warmth. Conversely,
          lower temperatures result in the use of cooler colors and more rectangular shapes to evoke a cool feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temperature sensor incorporates Adafruit’s sensor in conjunction with Arduino and utilizes p5.js’s serial
          port for data transmission to p5.js. Subsequently, p5.js maps the temperature data to a specific range,
          generating shape probabilities based on the mapped values.

        <p>
          H. Lorenzo is a fashion boutique known for curating avant-garde and high-end designer clothing. It’s
          recognized for its unique selection of clothing, often featuring cutting-edge designs and emerging designers
          alongside established luxury brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve crafted an avant-garde brand tone in my branding project, blending elegance and simplicity into the
          exclusive H Type font for H.Lorenzo. Beyond this, I aspire to elevate our brand’s spatial design, inviting
          customers into an immersive experience that embodies unconventional attitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the perspective of materials, I used different curves to create the effect of cloth and controlled the
          movement of the shape through the X and Y axes of the mouse to bring about different dynamics. At the same
          time, I added sliders to the code to control the shape and color. From black and white to primary color.</p>
        <p>
          I then added key press controls, using ‘b’ and ‘w’ to change the theme color of the background, ‘backspace’ to
          clear the content on the canvas, ‘up’ and ‘down’ to control the speed of shape generation, and ‘f’ to Stop
          generation, ‘p’ turns on full screen mode and ‘s’ to save pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all that, I feel mouse movement is not enough and I added body tracking model ml5 to my code to use
          camera tracking body as the source that driven pattern generation.

          becomes black like game over. This is following the unconventional way of magazine WIRED’s information

          understanding of light pollution situations in different states of the US, and be encouraged to take
          action to protect our night sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state names on the poster are connected with real data about light strength, night quality, sky
          clarity, etc. All data used is real data from Globe at Night.

        <h2>Ning Hong &mdash; Flowing Narrative</h2>
        <p>
          “Flowing Narrative” showcases the artistic vision of Lygia Pape, a pioneering Brazilian artist who pushed
          the boundaries of traditional art forms to create dynamic and immersive experiences. Through her works,
          Pape explored themes of movement, light, and the human experience, often incorporating unconventional
          materials and techniques. This exhibition brings together a selection of Pape's most celebrated pieces,
          including installations, sculptures, and prints, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the artist’s
          poetic and captivating world. With “Flowing Narrative,” we celebrate Lygia Pape's enduring legacy as a
          visionary artist who continues to inspire and challenge us with her extraordinary creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhibition’s website offers an interactive experience that allows users to view introductions about
          specific artworks. This unique feature presents a generative page containing elements from the artwork,
          bridging between the art and digital formats.

        <h2>Kenny Zhang &mdash; A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems</h2>
        <p>
          A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961. It is built as a set of
          10 sonnets, with each line on a separate strip that can be combined infinitely, for a total of
          100,000,000,000,000 different poems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project uses generative typography that brings the book’s content into creative coding. By
          reconstructing the 10 sonnets into an interactive 3D experience, it explores the intersection between poem
          and code and the transformation of poems from print-based to code-based media.

        <h2>Grace Kim &mdash; Duomo Module-Type Generator</h2>
        <p>
          The Duomo Museum (Museo del Duomo) originates inside the Duomo cathedral (Duomo di Milano) in Italy. They
          are exhibiting heritage marble sculptures and paintings; This is where you can enjoy the beautiful colors
          of sacred stained glass and artworks from over 600 years of history. I visited Duomo di Milano back in
          2016 with my friend. I was amazed by the magnificent cathedral when I got out of the subway station. It
          was one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture I had ever seen. Out of everything else, I loved the
          geometric yet delicate architectural motifs the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Duomo module-type generator’s main concept is creating a module type inspired by motifs from the
          gothic Duomo cathedral. Each letter design produced from the generator will be part of the branding
          deliverables in many applications. The primary touch point with the audience is at a ticket purchase
          machine. Each museum customer can interact with the Duomo module-type generator by typing their name for
          the ticket purchase to the exhibition. Audiences can choose between twelve module shapes and can control
          their size, density, rotation, and background colors. Each of them will get their own uniquely designed
          tickets as souvenirs before entering the cathedral and exhibition.

        <p>
          Boiler Room teamed up with LA’s Subculture Party to put together an explosive weekend of hyperpop,
          electronic, and experimental sounds. Having gone on Day 1, I thought it would be fun to take on the
          overwhelming event that it was (in terms of sounds, visuals, and people), and translate it into posters of
          my personal interpretation. I created a poster series that used sound visualization, mapping, and
          TextToPoints; some of the key skills I learned in Gen Type and now feel that I can apply to future
          projects.

          Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The

          This project is an exploration of music visualization inspired
          by the 88rising brand along with Head in the Clouds the music
          event curated by it. All the music-reacting animations were made
          on Processing. The music is from Blank&Jones, named Winelight.
          All the background images and footage were materials found on
          the Internet.
