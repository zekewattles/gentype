                Bloom is an infographic, interactive experience for The
                Huntington. It showcases its gardens and unique plants in a
                playful, typographic way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Analog making has always been a significant part of my creative
                process. I am interested in combinging analog and generative
                design methods, challenging myself to design a digital interface
                with an organic aesthetic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bloom uses hand drawn illustrations of plants from The
                Huntington's different gardens as units that formulate the names
                of the gardens. Users can use the arrow keys to visit different
                virtual gardens.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sketch mainly uses the Geomerative and peasycam libraries.
                The Geomerative library turns the outlines of the letters into
                points. The points are replaced by the illustration PNGs.
                Peasycam allows users to rotate and zoom in and out of the
                gardens to observe the sketch from different angles.

                FLEE is a brand identity generator designed to give flea market
                vendors the freedom to create their own visual identities and
                collateral.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name "FLEE" is inspired by the timelessness of flea markets,
                encouraging shoppers to escape from the present and travel to
                different eras.
              </p>
              <p>
                FLEE's vintage funky colors and random variations provide a
                unique playfulness that current flea market identities usually
                lack. The generator contains six different types of brushes, a
                clear canvas function, and a save image function. The user can
                also create with a scatter brush, a sticker brush, and a typing
                brush in the generator.

                >X is an experimental typeface design project. Through
                processing, this project built a physical font system using
                Geomerative and Fisica. Just like the skeleton binding of the
                animation, the anchor points on the outer outline of the font
                are bound by joints, giving the dynamic font more variability
                and organic feel. This visual system discusses the possibility
                of giving type and graphics a spontaneous and flexible
                characteristic.

                Storm King Art Center is dedicated to exhibiting, acquiring,

              <p>
                The phrase "connect to art, connect to nature" is a brand
                narrative. Storm King Art Center nurtures a vibrant bond between
                art, nature, and people, creating a place where discovery is
                limitless. Each small particles used in the design represents
                art, nature, and people, vibrantly bonding to connect to each
                other to form the phrase "connect to art, connect to nature".
              </p>
              <p>
                The custom typeface has been designed to be responsive and
                activated by motion. To achieve this, the typeface was put into
                code and synced with the movement so that the particles
                responded to the movement.

                88rising is a company that has gained popularity as a musical
                platform and record label primarily for Asian American and Asian
                artists who release music in the United States. The founder of
                88rising hopes the music it produced can bridge the gap between
                Asian and American music. Keeping producing experimental music
                going viral among young generations, 88rising gathers talented
                music artists to create new trends in pop culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project is an exploration of music visualization inspired
                by the 88rising brand along with Head in the Clouds the music
                event curated by it. All the music-reacting animations were made
                on Processing. The music is from Blank&Jones, named Winelight.
                All the background images and footage were materials found on
                the Internet.
